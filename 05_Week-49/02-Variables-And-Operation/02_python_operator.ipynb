    "\n",
    "1. **Arithmetic Operators:** These operators are used to perform mathematical calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more. For example:\n",
    "   - `+` (Addition): Adds two numbers together.\n",
    "   - `-` (Subtraction): Subtracts one number from another.\n",
    "   - `*` (Multiplication): Multiplies two numbers.\n",
    "   - `/` (Division): Divides one number by another.\n",
    "   - `%` (Modulo): Gives the remainder of a division.\n"

    "2. **Comparison Operators:** These operators are used to compare two values and return a Boolean result (True or False). They are often used in conditional statements like `if` and `while`. For example:\n",
    "   - `==` (Equal to): Checks if two values are equal.\n",
    "   - `!=` (Not equal to): Checks if two values are not equal.\n",
    "   - `<` (Less than): Checks if one value is less than another.\n",
    "   - `>` (Greater than): Checks if one value is greater than another.\n",
    "   - `<=` (Less than or equal to): Checks if one value is less than or equal to another.\n",
    "   - `>=` (Greater than or equal to): Checks if one value is greater than or equal to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Logical Operators:** These operators are used to combine or modify Boolean values (True or False). They are often used to create more complex conditions. For example:\n",
    "   - `and` (Logical AND): Returns True if both conditions are True.\n",
    "   - `or` (Logical OR): Returns True if at least one condition is True.\n",
    "   - `not` (Logical NOT): Negates the value of a condition."

    "4. **Assignment Operators:** These operators are used to assign values to variables. The most common assignment operator is `=` (assignment). For example:\n",
    "   - `x = 5` assigns the value 5 to the variable `x`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Bitwise Operators:** These operators work on individual bits of binary numbers. They are used in low-level programming and operations involving binary data.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Membership Operators:** These operators are used to test if a value is present in a sequence, such as a list or a string. For example:\n",
    "   - `in` checks if a value is in a sequence.\n",
    "   - `not in` checks if a value is not in a sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Identity Operators:** These operators are used to compare the memory locations of two objects. They are often used to check if two variables reference the same object. For example:\n",
    "   - `is` checks if two variables refer to the same object.\n",
    "   - `is not` checks if two variables do not refer to the same object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operators are fundamental to writing programs because they allow you to perform a wide range of operations and make decisions in your code. Depending on the task at hand, you'll use different operators to achieve your desired results."
