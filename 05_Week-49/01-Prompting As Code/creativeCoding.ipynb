    "Creative coding is the practice of using computer programming to create art, design, and interactive experiences. It combines technical skills with artistic expression, allowing artists and designers to explore new forms of creativity through code.\n",
    " \n",
    " Some examples of creative coding include:\n",
    " - Generative art: Creating artwork using algorithms and randomness\n",
    " - Interactive installations: Building experiences that respond to user input\n",
    " - Data visualization: Representing data in visually compelling ways\n",
    " - Digital art: Using code to create static or animated digital artwork\n",
