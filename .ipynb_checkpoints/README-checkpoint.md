# Unveiled AI: down the rabbit hole of symbols, ethics and aesthetics

- Basic Seminar "Code"
- Thursdays weekly 11 am – 1 pm
- Filzengraben 8 - 10, 0.2 [ ] ground zero, Academy of Media Arts Cologne ([KHM](https://www.khm.de/))

The seminar covers the basics of practical cultural work with generative AI, and participants are not required to have previous programming knowledge. By learning the universal programming language Python, we will experimentally explore practical aspects and break down current AI tools for film, animation, image, sound, and text generation into their individual components. This approach not only helps us develop our own aesthetics and ways of expression with AI tools but also better understand their semantics so that we can question them in an aesthetic—research-oriented way.

However, as we learn to develop our own aesthetics in dealing with AI, a responsibility is placed on our shoulders that we are just learning to deal with as a society. The seminar therefore focuses not only on the practical-experimental exploration of generative AI, but also on the societal, social, ecological and cultural consequences of our increasing use of AI in art and cultural work: With every prompt for text generation by ChatGPT, you could also charge your smartphone 60 times − The training datasets and AI-generated artworks expand and violate our copyrights and personal rights − Discriminatory tendencies that seem to be inherent in generative AIs are also inscribed in artistic works − The same software packages that are considered creative tools in our context are actively used in Ukraine and Gaza to perform military operations. So it is not only our own visual/language that is currently being changed through the use of AI, but also our social role as cultural workers in the world.
